# A PHP calendar

This is a pure and vanilla PHP calendar, featuring a drop down menu to select a year and month, with previous and back buttons.

Dates from the previous month are included if necessary to prevent leaving blank spaces, as well as any dates from the next month.

Caution: Contains no validation
